        <div class="content">
            Hello guys, in this blog I have listed down <b>7 Powerful Chrome Extensions for Students</b> that I find
            very helpful. <br>
            So first of all let's explain to you a little what extensions are and how they work , so extensions are
            basically built on<b>web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS </b>. They run in a separate,
            sandboxed execution environment and interact with the Chrome browser. Extensions let you "extend" the
            browser by using APIs to modify browser behavior and access web content. <br>
            Today, we can find thousands of extensions on the <a
                href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon">chrome web
                store</a> which are definitely categorized for ease of searching. The main categories that are available
            are <b>Runs Offline, By Google, Free, Available for Android, and also themed extensions. </b><br>
            Now that we know what Extensions are, let’s have a look at the 7 extensions listed below. <br>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">
            1. <a
                href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon"><u>SponsorBlock
                    For Youtube:</u></a>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            Many times it happens that we are fully determined to study, but when we start to watch a youtube tutorial
            then in the middle of the tutorial there is some sponsored part which is very annoying and disturbs our
            entire focus of study. This extension is a solution for all students facing this problem. What this
            extension does is that it lets you skip over sponsors, intros, outros, subscription reminders, and other
            annoying parts of YouTube videos. It is a crowdsourced browser extension that lets anyone submit the start
            and end times of sponsored segments and other segments of YouTube videos. Once a person submits this
            information, everyone else with this extension will skip right over the sponsored segment.

                    https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon</u>

            "><u>Unpaywall:</u></a>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            Coming to our second extension, this extension might be also very useful for students as it happens often
            with students that they open a website for getting a solution or maybe reading an article but it asks for a
            subscription, so the solution to this problem is right over here.
            Unpaywall gets the full text of scholarly articles as you browse. When you view a research article, it
            automatically looks for a copy in its index of 20 million free, legal full-text PDFs. If they find one, then
            all we need to do is click the green tab to read the article and that’s it. Hence this extension might be
            useful for you too.

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            StayFocusd increases your productivity by limiting the amount of time that you can spend on time-wasting
            websites.
            You sit down at the computer, and you swear you’ll be productive. Next thing you know, it’s twelve hours
            later. You’ve checked your email, updated your Facebook status, blown through 200 posts or reels on
            Instagram, looked up your favorite band on Wikipedia, cyber-stalked your ex, and lost a week’s pay playing
            online poker. What you haven’t done is WORK. <br>
            StayFocusd is a productivity extension for Google Chrome that helps you stay focused on work by restricting
            the amount of time you can spend on time-wasting websites. Once your allotted time has been used up, the
            sites you have blocked will be inaccessible for the rest of the day. <br>
            It’s highly configurable, allowing you to block or allow entire sites, specific subdomains, specific paths,
            specific pages, even specific in-page content (videos, games, images, forms, etc). This is a very useful
            extension for students who get distracted easily.

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            This is a very helpful extension as many times there is an issue of recording our screen with our video
            attached so for this we need to install an entire application on our system, but not anymore, as this
            extension allows you to record your screens and also your video if you wish to include it. <br>
            Loom allows you to record just your current tab or your entire screen, and choose whether you’d like to
            include a thumbnail video of your face on the webcam. Plus, you can share the videos instantly, and even
            choose whether the video needs a password to be seen. <br>
            The best part is that there’s no limit to how much you can record — and it’s 100% free! <br>

        <div class="content">
            Many of you would already have heard the name of this extension in the youtube ads and if you still aren’t
            using this, you are really missing out on something very helpful as Grammarly checks the grammar and
            spelling of everything you write online. Never again will you make a silly typo or grammar mistake in your
            emails, Facebook comments, tweets, and so on. What’s more, it doesn’t just check spellings but offers
            accurate, context-specific suggestions. The Chrome extension is free, but Grammarly also has some extra
            premium features available for a monthly fee, but even the non-premium functions are already very helpful.

            organize resources and notes online. This incredible tool also syncs across all of your devices and even

            Evernote is free, but also offers premium business features for a monthly fee. This extension could prove to
            be efficient for the students that want to keep all their notes in one place. <br>
