            laptop. When any of us buy a new laptop or computer its difficult for us to remember what apps do we need to
            install and not only this ,we need to visit n number of sites for installing n number of different apps
            which is obviously annoying as when we should be busy exploring the features of our new laptop or computer
            we are busy making all the installations. So for removing this difficulty from your life we have this site
            ,here we have a list of all the basic applications or softwares which we need at the time of installation
            from all the categories like Web Browsing,Documents,Meets,Online storage,media and also development tools.

            system and you just need to install the file normally as you install any other application and voila all
            your selected apps are now installed on your system and ready to get used.

            Well if you are a Youtuber or a content creator and you need a proper intro for your channel well this is the place where you can find classic to super crazy intros and that too all for free . You can edit these intros and give the required text and give it new features like different colors, font size and font style. The effect settings are a bit conceptual to be honest but yes with little practice you get perfect with time on it. Although it’s not a very big problem as most of the effects are pre designed and can be readily used for the editing or making of the intros. <br>
For creating an intro all you need is you need to go on this website and select the intro or clip you think best for you and click on it and then it will take you to a project window, after this just edit the video with the text and download it, so after this we are ready with our intro. <br>
The website also provides some extra features like Backgrounder and video editor which can also be explored by you depending upon the need you have.

            To be honest this website is not very productive but still you are going to love this if you are a 90’s kid and if you are in love with Windows 95 ,windows 93 or windows 98 as all of these are available on this website it created a virtual os selected by you and gives you a feel of the operating system on the website itself. The interesting part here is that you get to experience the operating system with the old applications and and the new ones like you will be able to see applications like VS Code ,Discord , Github and on the other hand plenty of old 90’s games like Tomb Raider, Street Fighter Alpha and Wolfenstein 3D are available. So all over this website is not very productive but it is a very interesting website that I need to admit.

        <div class="content">
            This website is very useful at times when you are a singer and you only need the background music of the song that you want to practice or perform. So what this site does is it separates the lyrics and the vocals of the song.
            We need to just go to the website and drop our song and there we go we have both the lyrics and vocals of the song separated. It also has some features like a karaoke recorder,audio recorder,audio cutter,audio converter and audio joiner.We can definitely make use of them depending upon the need.

        <div class="content">
            So coming to the last website this website is used for developers around the world. Now with the growing demand of programming many of us want to program and run our code and mostly we use VS Code for this but now it’s not compulsory that the laptop or computer you are working on must have VS Code installed on it. <br>
The solution to this is this particular website as it lets you code online and not only this but save your projects online you can code in almost any of the popular programming languages like C++,C,Python,Java and many more. <br>
Now for those who are comparing this website with onlineGdb.com ,we surely can but repl.it has a leading edge as it gives us features like we can host our projects say our Discord Bot or anything like that and also we have an option for creating a Database for the project. So this website at the end is a blessing for programmers.

            So I guess at the end I was able to make this blog an interesting one and I also tried to cover websites from different sectors so that it does not get boring and each website may be a new journey for you. These 7 websites according to me are really cool websites and you can use them in your daily life for interesting stuff.
